			<p class="fadeIn">Somewhere out in the middle-west of America, on a road that's long since been made obsolete by the advent of the Interstate System, there's a bar.</p>

			<p class="fadeIn">It doesn't look like much from the outside: an old silver Airstream hooked up to a generator and wrapped in pink Christmas lights.
			<br />
			<br />
			There's nothing else for miles around but trees and fields,</p>
		
		<br />

			<p class="fadeIn" style="text-align: center;">trees and fields,</p>

			But let's be honest,

		<br />
		<br />

			<p class="fadeIn" style="text-align: center">No one much comes here in broad daylight.</p>
